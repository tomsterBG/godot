## 2D and 3D cross-platform game engine

**[Godot Engine](https://godotengine.org) is a feature-packed, cross-platform
game engine to create 2D and 3D games from a unified interface.** It provides a
comprehensive set of [common tools](https://godotengine.org/features), so that
users can focus on making games without having to reinvent the wheel. Games can
be exported with one click to a number of platforms, including the major desktop
platforms (Linux, macOS, Windows), mobile platforms (Android, iOS), as well as
Web-based platforms and [consoles](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/latest/tutorials/platform/consoles.html).

## Free, open source and community-driven

Godot is completely free and open source under the very permissive [MIT license](https://godotengine.org/license).
No strings attached, no royalties, nothing. The users' games are theirs, down
to the last line of engine code. Godot's development is fully independent and
community-driven, empowering users to help shape their engine to match their
expectations. It is supported by the [Godot Foundation](https://godot.foundation/)
not-for-profit.

Before being open sourced in [February 2014](https://github.com/godotengine/godot/commit/0b806ee0fc9097fa7bda7ac0109191c9c5e0a1ac),
Godot had been developed by [Juan Linietsky](https://github.com/reduz) and
[Ariel Manzur](https://github.com/punto-) (both still maintaining the project)
for several years as an in-house engine, used to publish several work-for-hire
titles.

## Getting the engine

### Binary downloads

Official binaries for the Godot editor and the export templates can be found
[on the Godot website](https://godotengine.org/download).

### Compiling from source

[See the official docs](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/latest/contributing/development/compiling)
for compilation instructions for every supported platform.

## Community and contributing

Godot is not only an engine but an ever-growing community of users and engine
developers. The main community channels are listed [on the homepage](https://godotengine.org/community).

The best way to get in touch with the core engine developers is to join the
[Godot Contributors Chat](https://chat.godotengine.org).

To get started contributing to the project, see the [contributing guide](CONTRIBUTING.md).
This document also includes guidelines for reporting bugs.

## Documentation and demos

The official documentation is hosted on [Read the Docs](https://docs.godotengine.org).
It is maintained by the Godot community in its own [GitHub repository](https://github.com/godotengine/godot-docs).

The [class reference](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/latest/classes/)
is also accessible from the Godot editor.

We also maintain official demos in their own [GitHub repository](https://github.com/godotengine/godot-demo-projects)
as well as a list of [awesome Godot community resources](https://github.com/godotengine/awesome-godot).

There are also a number of other
[learning resources](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/latest/community/tutorials.html)
provided by the community, such as text and video tutorials, demos, etc.
Consult the [community channels](https://godotengine.org/community)
for more information.

## Branch \<version>++

This branch extends the `godot` version of my choice with my own changes.
Every time i want to update:
- Find the commit of the version i want to modify. Ways to find the commit are from the bottom right in the engine and from <https://godotengine.github.io/godot-interactive-changelog>.
- Run and test the editor compiled in that commit. Some unstable editors have bugs so it's best to stick to stable releases.
- Update `tomsterBG/godot/<version>` to the latest updates and fetch locally.
- Use `git checkout -b <version>++ commit-hash` and use the hash of the found commit. When doing this, you must locally be on the branch containing this commit.
- Add all commits from the latest `<version>++` branch, to the new one.

All new features should have unit tests and documentation.
To prevent overrides where i don't want them, i should not commit doc changes or similar cosmetic edits that would be better contributed to `godot/master`.
Only commit well-made features from separate branches and stuff that are unlikely to be added to the official engine.
